# RANDOM-FOREST-IMPLEMENTATION
RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM ON TITANIC DATASET.

THE COMMIT CONSISTS OF A PYTHON - 3 IMPLEMENTATION OF RANDOM FOEST CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM.
THE PROCEDURE INVOLVED IS :

-- TITANIC DATASET IS LOADED FROM LOCAL MACHINE , AND DATACLEANING IS DONE SO AS TO REMOVE ALL THE REDUNDANT COLUMNS.

-- ALL THE NaNs ARE FILLED WITH CLOSEST APPROXIMATIONS SO AS TO MAKE THE DATA CONCRETE.

-- THE STRING VALUES ARE CONVERTED ONTO INTEGRAL VALUES SO THAT IT COULD BE USED FOR ANALYSIS.

-- THE DATA IS THEN SPLIT INTO TRAINING AND TESTING DATA.

-- USED RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM AVAILABLE IN SKLEARN MODULE.

-- IMPLEMENTED RANDOM FOREST , CHANGING SOME PARAMETERS FOR BETTER ACCURACY.

-- OBSERVED THAT RANDOM FORESTS WORK PRETTY GOOD ON TRAINING DATA WITH A SCORE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO 0.95.

-- AS TITANIC DATASET , CONTAINS LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA , IT GOES WELL WITH RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM.
